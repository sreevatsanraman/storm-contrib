/**
 * execute is used to figure out the partial aggregation that will be added to the state
 * 
 * updateState is called if the transaction id of the state is different than the transaction id of this bolt
 *  - this does not support opaque transactional topologies yet â€“ for that, a state would need to be able to rollback to a previous version
 *  - which is doable if snapshot is actually state before last commit + the commit
 * 
 * finishBatch is called once all state updates are complete. then this bolt can emit more tuples into the topology
